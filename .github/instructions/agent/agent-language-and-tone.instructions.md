# Agent Language and Tone Behavior Instructions

## Purpose

- Define one shared standard for language and tone in agent behavior.
- Keep agent and instruction assets consistent and easy to maintain.

## Project Language Configuration

- Expected result language: English.
- Optional project content language: Dutch.
- To adapt this for another project, update only the `Expected result language` value.

## Language Rules

- Use the configured expected result language as default for all agent outputs.
- Use another language only when the user explicitly asks for it or a target artifact requires it.
- Keep one consistent language per response unless a mixed-language format is explicitly requested.

## Common Tone for Agent Results

- Use a concise, direct, and friendly tone.
- Be actionable first: lead with clear next steps and decisions.
- Avoid unnecessary verbosity and avoid slang.
- Keep wording professional and collaborative.

## Quick Compliance Check

- [ ] Default output language follows the configured expected result language.
- [ ] Output tone is concise, direct, friendly, and actionable.
